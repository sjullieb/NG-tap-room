##Description

A small Angular app for a bar to track their kegs.

## User stories

* As a patron, the user can see a list/menu of all available kegs. For each keg there are name, brand, price, style of beer, and alcohol content.
As an employee, the user can fill out a form when you tap a new keg to add it to the list.
* As an employee, the user should have an option to edit a keg's properties after entering them just in case there is a mistake.
* As a patron and/or employee, the user can see how many pints are left in a keg. (A full keg has roughly 124 pints).
* As an employee, the user can click a button next to a keg whenever a pint of it is sold. This should decrease the number of pints left by 1.
* As an employee, the user can see kegs with less than 10 pints left to be ready to change them.
* The kegs prices are color-coded for easy readability based on the particular style of beer.
* Based on the the alcohol content property the stronger beers (over 7% alcohol) are displayed in bold.

##Specs

* List of all available kegs for each keg input: Name, Brand, Price, Style of Beer (color-coded), AlcoholContent (stronger AlcoholContent > 7% is bold), Pints left (124 pints per keg), Button to -1 Pint

* Option to **Show** kegs with less than 10 pints left (dropdown)

* Form to add **New** keg to the list
